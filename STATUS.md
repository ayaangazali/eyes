# STATUS

Updated: 2026-10-17 00:40 PT by orchestrator. Gate: **G0 passed**, G1 in progress. Merged: #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #8 #10 #12 (+#13 merging). **ESCALATED: T1.5 safety (#7) failed verification 3 times; waiting on humans: A = one more round with the verifier's tested fix, B = merge now and follow up.**

## Needs from humans (G0)

Keys go in `.env` at the repo root (never committed) and later as Manufact env vars. Exact names are in `.env.example`.

1. InsForge: create a project. `INSFORGE_BASE_URL`, `INSFORGE_ANON_KEY`, `INSFORGE_API_KEY` (ik_...).
2. Inkbox: console API key `INKBOX_API_KEY`; create identity `eyes-dispatch` with a US number (`INKBOX_PHONE_NUMBER`). Provision at least 1 hour before any live text (10DLC takes 10 to 15 min). Every worker phone must text START to it first.
3. Stripe: new sandbox, enable Connect and set platform branding. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (sk_test_). At deploy, two event destinations both pointing to `/webhooks/stripe`: "Your account" with `checkout.session.completed` (`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) and "Connected accounts" with `account.updated` (`STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). Pre-fund the platform with card 4000 0000 0000 0077 before demos.
4. Primitive: sign up, note the auto-assigned `*.primitive.email` domain (`PRIMITIVE_DOMAIN`), `PRIMITIVE_API_KEY`, `PRIMITIVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Ask staff to enable `send_to_any_domain`.
5. Anthropic: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (vision + safety classifier). Also add it as a repo secret to enable `claude-verifier` and `safety-llm-eval`.
6. Manufact: `MCP_USE_API_KEY` and org slug.
7. Armature: `ANALYTICS_INGEST_API_KEY`; ask them to enable Evaluation; confirm mcp-use support.
8. Decisions: worker phones for the demo (whose, how many), demo cafe, public domain (or use Manufact + InsForge default URLs).
9. Hackathon rules: the event page publishes no rule on pre-start code. Ask the organizers (host Ray Liao) before 10:30 AM.
